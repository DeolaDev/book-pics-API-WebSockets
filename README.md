# A single page 'Book Pictures' application + API

Users can send a text to my TWILIO number with a picture of their favourite book and have it displayed on the webpage.

Framework used: Vue.js

APIs used:

- Vue API to render the images
- Twilo Messaging API (to get the data from all incoming messages)
- Designed a web based API to parse the data and return the expected JSON format
